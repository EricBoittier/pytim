Pytim's Main Features
=====================


* It's easy to use! While many optional arguments can be used to trigger special features,
  or to fine-tune the behavior of the algorithm, just invoking the class with the minimal
  set of arguments, as in the example shown here, delivers what you expect.

* Works for planar (:mod:`~pytim.itim`)  and arbitrary (:mod:`~pytim.gitim`) interfaces

* Thanks to MDAnalysis_, Pytim can work with several common file formats, including:

  - CHARMM & NAMD,
  - LAMMPS
  - GROMACS
  - AMBER
  - DL_POLY
  - GAMESS

  For the full list see the Supported_Formats_

* It's *fast!* The planar interface identification, as well as the clustering analysis to filter the vapor or diluted phases both scale in theory, in the average case, like O(N log N). In practice, sublinear scaling is observed for systems up to 10,000 atoms, and ~ O(N^1.3) up to 100,000 atoms, on an 1,7 GHz Intel Core i7. The surface identification for a system of 10,000 atoms, for example, requires only 0.2 s on this hardware.

* It comes with several analysis tools, specifically written for the properties of the interfacial atoms, such as

  - in-layer radial distribution functions
  - intrinsic and non-intrinsic density profiles
  - calculation of surface triangulation and associated geometrical parameters
  - ...


* It is easy to extend: as it relies on the MDAnalysis_ interface,
  it is easy to modify the core classes and/or to add new observables
