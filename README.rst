A Python Tool for Interfacial Molecules Analysis
================================================

This is a port of ITIM/GITIM to python, based on MDAnalysis: it 
allows to identify interfacial molecules from the trajectories
of major molecular dynamics simulation packages, and run some
analyses specifically conceived for interfacial molecules.
